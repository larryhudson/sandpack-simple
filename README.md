# Play with HTML, CSS and JavaScript

Sandpack is a new tool from CodeSandbox that lets you add an interactive code editor, with a build step, to a React app. The build step happens in the browser!

This is a simple web app that lets you play with HTML, CSS and JavaScript with instant feedback.

I'd like to explore how this can be used to make interactive code challenges for beginner web devs.

You can view the demo here: (insert demo link here). 

To get up and running:
- `git clone` this repo
- `npm install`
- `npm run dev`
- open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) in your web browser.
